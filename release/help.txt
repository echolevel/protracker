ProTracker v2.3D clone for modern platforms                            2010-2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This help file was written by Lars "ZAP" Hamre and others back in the early 90s
 It was heavily edited by me.
 
 == Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) ==
 
 * I get a "CONFIG NOT FOUND" error, even if I have protracker.ini in the same
   directory as the program...
 - This is a problem with macOS 10.12. Make a directory called .protracker in your
   home directory, and copy protracker.ini inside it.
 
 * Is there a way to make the window bigger?
 - Set VIDEOSCALE to 2X, 3x or 4X in protracker.ini.

 * Is there a way to run the program in fullscreen mode?
 - Press F11.

 * How do I change the stereo separation (panning)?
 - Adjust the STEREOSEPARATION setting in protracker.ini. It's a percentage
   value ranging from 0 to 100. 0 being mono and 100 being 100% separated like
   the audio output from an Amiga.
   Pressing SHIFT+F12 will toggle between STEREOSEPARATION and 100% (hard pan).

 * Can this ProTracker clone load PT.Config files?
 - Yes. Put one in the same directory as the executable program, and it will
   load the first one it can find (PT.Config-00..99).
   It will override some of the settings from protracker.ini.

 * Will there ever be MIDI support?
 - No, sorry. Try a modern module tracker instead, or ProTracker on the Amiga.

 * Will there ever be external audio sampling support?
 - Very unlikely, but maybe if I find a portable way between different OSes.
 
 * Is there a quick way to clear an editable text string in the GUI?
 - Right click while in text edit mode.
 
 * Is there a quick way to save my module?
 - Press CTRL+S. This hotkey is "split mode" in Amiga ProTracker, which is not
   included in this PT clone.
   
 * Can I revert a sample after I edited it?
 - Press CTRL+Z while the sampler screen is open.

 * Can I quick-jump to an entry in the Disk Op. directory lister?
 - Press SHIFT+character while Disk Op. is open.

 * Will you ever make a ProTracker 3.x clone? ProTracker 3.x rulez!
 - Forget it. I'm not a fan of PT3.x, and here are some of the reasons:
   1) It doesn't play PT1.x/2.x MODs correctly (f.ex: sample swap is removed)
   2) The GUI looks and acts as if it's unfinished (unused buttons and so on)
   3) The design is messy and not intuitive (PT2.x is also bad, but way better)

 * [insert random question]
 - Try to send an email to olav.sorensen@live.no or visit #protracker at IRCnet.


 == Some misc. info ==

 When a MOD is modified, an asterisk (*) is shown to the left of the module name
 in the window title. If the program receives a SIGTERM or is quit with the
 cross (X) in the window bar, it will quit without asking, but only if the MOD
 was not modified.
 
 WARNING: Note B-3 (or pitches getting near; pitch slides, vibrato or arpeggio)
 may not play correctly on a real Amiga. It might crackle/pop because of a
 DMA underrun. Take extra care when doing high pitches!

 
 == Missing things that will NOT be added in the future ==
  
  * Split keys (kinda pointless without MIDI). ctrl+s is now used for MOD saving
  * MIDI support
  * Setup screen
  
 
 == Some ProTracker keybindings are used by other things in OS X! ==
 
  - In OS X, go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts and
    disable keybindings that could interrupt with any PT keybindings.
 
 
 == Where's the Amiga key? ==
 
 PC keyboard:
    Left Amiga key = left Windows key
   Right Amiga key = right Alt Gr key
 
 Mac keyboard:
    Left Amiga key = left Command key
   Right Amiga key = right Command key


 == Non-ProTracker additions ==
 
 * New keybindings:
   alt+F11   - Toggle between real/fake VU-Meters
   F11       - Toggle fullscreen
   F12       - Toggle Amiga model (for low-pass filter)
   shift+F12 - Toggle Amiga panning (100% stereo separation)
   ctrl+F12  - Toggle CIA/VBLANK timing for tempo/speed effect (Fxx)
   alt+F12   - Toggle logging terminal
   
 * Toggle channels by right clicking on the scopes
    
 * MOD2WAV button for rendering the current song to a .WAV file.
   Read more about this function in the MAINSCREEN chapter.
 
 * PAT2SMP button for rendering the current pattern (from current row)
   to the current sample slot. Read more about this function in the
   MAINSCREEN chapter.
 
 * Sample draw tool!
   Use right mouse button to edit sample data in the sampler like in FT2
   (hold SHIFT key to stop drawing in the y axis, for making steady lines)
   
 * Sample "restore" keybinding (ctrl+z when sampler screen is open)
   When a sample is loaded its attributes and datas are copied to a temp buffer.
   If you press ctrl+z, the current sample's data+attributes will be restored.
   Now you don't need to reload a sample when you make a change you regret!
   
 * WAV sample loader.
	 Supports the following WAVs: 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit and 32-bit float.
	 The WAV samples are mixed to mono and quantized to 8-bit.
   It also attempts to load the "SMPL" chunk to get loop points and
   volume from sampler WAVs and Open ModPlug Tracker and the like.
   
 * PAGE UP/DOWN and HOME/END works in POS-ED, DISK OP. and the pattern editor
   (and HOME/END works while editing strings)
   
 * Low-pass and high-pass filters in the sampler editor
 
 * Logging terminal (press ALT+F12 to toggle it)
 
 * Some more stuff added to make life easier, like mouse wheel support.

 Now follows the main parts of this help file.
 

               MAINSCREEN
               ----------
 ## PLAY ##
 Will play the song from the current song position. The pointer turns yellow,
 just to show you what's going on. If you hold right mouse button while
 clicking, it will play from the current row. Useful for checking if parts
 of the pattern sounds right, instead of playing from the beginning all
 the time.

 ## PATTERN ##
 Will play the current pattern which is shown at the bottom of the screen.
 The pointer turns yellow here as well. If you hold right mouse button while
 clicking, it will play from the current row. Useful for checking if parts
 of the pattern sounds right, instead of playing from the beginning all
 the time.

 ## EDIT ##
 Will put you in edit mode. The pointer turns blue, and you can enter notes
 and numbers from the keyboard. Use the arrow keys to move up/down and
 left/right in the pattern. Entering a note or a number will cause the
 pattern to jump one or more slots down, dependant on the EDITSKIP setting.

 ## RECORD ##
 Will put you in edit mode, but also play the current pattern or song.
 You can select this in the Edit Options menu. While the pattern or
 song is playing, you can type in notes and numbers from the keyboard,
 and they will appear in the pattern as it scrolls. The notes and numbers
 will also be quantized to the nearest row, so that keeping a steady rhythm
 is no problem (if you're good with realtime beats). The pointer will turn
 blue here as well as in the the normal edit mode.

 ## STOP ##
 Will stop playing of songs and patterns, recording, and will turn edit
 mode off. Can also be used to stop all looping samples when you're jamming.

 ## CLEAR ##
 Will first ask you what you want to clear. You can clear either all,
 song or samples.

 ## EDIT OP. ##
 Will exchange the spectrum analyzer or quadrascope with the edit menu(s).
 Pressing more than one time will browse through the edit op. screens.
 Click the "chord" button on screen 3 to get to the fourth screen.

 ## DISK OP. ##
 Will go to the load/save dialog.
 While in the DISK OP., you can press shift+character to jump
 to the first filename entry starting with that character.

 ## MOD2WAV ##
 Renders the current song to a 16-bit 44.1kHz stereo WAV file.
 Amiga panning mode, channel solo/mute, BLEP and the HP/LP filters are
 included in the rendering.

 ## PAT2SMP ##
 Renders the current pattern (from current row) to the current sample slot.
 This tool is handy for making drum loops. It will resample and mix (16-bit)
 active channels to mono. Normalization is done before quantizing to 8-bit,
 to preserve more of the audio data.
 
 - Quality mode: -
 HI: 28836Hz - Play the new sample at note A-3 (finetune +5)
 LO: 22168Hz - Play the new sample at note F-3 (finetune +1)
  
 High mode is better in quality, but usually can't fit a whole pattern.
 Low mode is pretty bad, but can usually fit a whole pattern.

 The low-pass and LED filters are NOT added to the PAT2SMP mixing, but the
 BLEP synthesis is left in to decrease some aliasing, though it's a bit buggy
 in LO mode (the BLEP routines are meant for deltas below 1.0).
 The solo/mute buttons are functional and handled in the PAT2SMP mixing.

 ## POS ED. ##
 This is the position editor screen found in ProTracker 2.2 or later.
 You can give patterns a name for organizing, but they are not saved
 in the module.

 ## SAMPLER ##
 Will go to the sampler screen.

 The small gadgets labeled

 ## 1, 2, 3 and 4 ##
 Represents the audio channels of your Ami.. I mean, non-Amiga computer.
 When lit, that channel is on. When not lit, the channel is muted and and
 the notes in that channel will not be played.
 If you hold the right mouse button while clicking, the channel will be solo'd.

 You can also use ctrl-a to toggle an audio channel, and ctrl-q to unmute all
 channels. ctrl+shift-a will solo the current channel.

 ## Tempo ##
 The tempo gadget on the status bar is for setting the CIA speed, if CIA
 timing is used. The gadget will be updated every time you set the speed
 using the F command (if CIA that is). To toggle between VBLANK/CIA,
 press ctrl+F12. This flag is not stored in the MOD file, so be careful.
 CIA is the standard mode, use it all the time unless you know what
 you're doing.



                DISK OP.
                --------

 ## Path ##
 The paths for modules and samples. It can be up to ~260 characters
 long, depending on the OS. Click on it to edit the path. Right click
 while editing to zero out all the text - handy for changing the drive.

 ## Pack ## (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
 When on, ProTracker will powerpack modules/samples before saving.

 ## Load module ##
 Will set the DISK OP. to LOAD MODULE mode. It will only list loadable
 files (MOD/STK/M15/PP extensions).

 ## Save module ##
 Will save the module to the current disk op. path. The filename will be
 <songname>.mod or mod.<songname> dependant on a protracker.ini setting.

 ## Load sample ##
 Will set the DISK OP. to LOAD SAMPLE mode. It will list all files in a dir.

 ## Save Sample ##
 Will save the current sample as WAV, IFF or RAW. Select this in the "SAVE"
 gadget to the left. Sample loop points are stored to IFF files.



                SAMPLER
                -------
 The new sampler/sample editor was included simply because we thought 
 the one in Noisetracker 2.0 was terrible, and we needed graphing of
 samples and proper loop editing. 

 It's very fast, much faster than Audiomaster, and the editing is
 much simpler. 

 We also included a resampling option which we hope you'll find useful.

 Editing
 -------
 When editing a sample, use the mouse to set the cursor line and to mark
 ranges.

 ## Waveform ##
 Will play the full sample with loops.

 ## Display ##
 Will play the part of the sample being shown on screen.

 ## Range ##
 Will play the marked range.

 ## Stop ##
 Will stop all playing of samples.

 ## Show range ##
 Will magnify the current range and display it.

 ## Show all ##
 Will display the whole sample.

 ## Beg ##
 Will put the cursor line at the beginning of the sample.
 Holding SHIFT while clicking will extend the marking to the beginning.
 
 ## End ##
 Will put the cursor line at the end of the sample.
 Holding SHIFT while clicking will extend the marking to the end.

 ## Center ##
 Will put the cursor line at the center of the sample.
 Holding SHIFT while clicking will extend the marking to the center.

 ## Zoom out ##
 Will show double the range you are displaying.

 ## Range all ##
 Will range the part of the sample being displayed on screen.

 ## Cut ## (or ctrl+X)
 Will cut the part of the sample that's marked.

 ## Copy ## (or ctrl+C)
 Will copy the marked range to the copy buffer.

 ## Paste ## (or ctrl+V)
 Will paste the copy buffer into the current sample.
 
 ## Volume ""
 Will take you to the volume tool box.
 
 ## Tunetone ##
 Will create a tuned sinus sound, which you can tune your samples after.
 
 ## Fix DC ##
 Will remove any eventual DC offset in the sample, which will make it centered.
 This function might not always work as intended, especially not on basic
 waveforms.
 
 ## Filters ##
 Will take you to the filters tool box.

 ## Offs (offset) ##
 This displays what 9xx command value to use to play the sample from where you're
 pointing at in the sample data. This will display no value if the position is
 equal to zero, since 900 means "use last 9xx value".
 Attempting to use 9xx on a sample where its length is over 65534 will silence
 the sample (PT bug), this is why Offs shows nothing on >64kB samples.

 ## Resample ##
 Here's a step-by-step explanation:

 1. Turn on the tuning tone.
 2. Use the keyboard to find what note it is. Use finetune if needed.
 3. Enter the note in the "Note:" box to the right. 
 4. Press resample!

 ## Note ##
 This is what note to resample to.

 ## Disp (display) ##
 This is the length of the part of the sample being shown on screen.

 ## Loop on/off ##
 This is for turning sample loops on/off without having to fiddle with the
 repeat and replen gadgets.
 
 ## Exit ##
 Exits the sampler screen. 


 The volume tool box
 --------------
 Set the "from" and "to" volume percentages by using the sliders,
 or just type in any number you please (from 0 to 200) in the
 percentage boxes to the right.

 ## Normalize ##
 Will find the highest volume settings possible (without clipping).

 ## Cancel ##
 Will exit the volume box.

 ## \ ##
 Will set the percentages 100%-0%

 ## / ##
 Will set the percentages 0%-100%

 ## - ##
 Will set the percentages 100%-100%

 ## Ramp ##
 Will ramp (calculate) the volume!


 The filters tool box
 --------------
 This tool box lets you low-pass or high-pass a sample.
 Cool for vocals and drumloops, or for any filtering needs.
 Keep in mind that this is far from an intelligent filter,
 the base frequency is manually set to 16574Hz, so the cutoff
 values really depend on the base frequency of the sample.
 This means that for example a 100Hz low-pass is 100Hz only if
 the base frequency of the sample is 16574Hz.
 Just test your way to the audible cutoff you want, and press
 UNDO if you didn't like it.

 ## Undo ##
 Restores the sample data to the previous state. Used for when you
 didn't like the new filtered value. Use CTRL+Z to completely
 restore the sample to the state of when it was loaded.

 ## Exit ##
 Will exit the volume box.

 ## Low-Pass ##
 Will low-pass the sample with the given cutoff frequency.

 ## Low-Pass Frequency ##
 Click on this to manually set a cutoff or use the up/down gadgets.

 ## High-Pass ##
 Will high-pass the sample with the given cutoff frequency.

 ## High-Pass Frequency ##
 Click on this to manually set a cutoff or use the up/down gadgets
 
 ## Normalize Sample ##
 Will normalize the sample after it has been filtered, before
 quantizing it to 8-bit. This will prevent clipping and also result
 in higher quality if the filtered result was low on amplitude.


                EDIT OP.
                --------

 The edit op. screens were just a handy way for us to implement all the new
 functions we had thought of. There are four screens, and you can browse 
 through them by pressing the edit op.  gadget more than once, or select one
 by clicking on the numbers 1-3. Screen four is accessed by clicking the "chord"
 button in edit op. screen 3.
               
 To exit edit op., click on the gadget labeled "E" or press ESC.

 
 Edit op. Screen 1:

 ## Transposing ##

 What is transposing ?

 Transposing lets you shift the pitch of the notes up or down. 
 E.g. Change a C-3 to a C#3.

 In comparison to other trackers, ProTracker lets you transpose in just
 about every way you can imagine. You can transpose either the current
 sample or all the samples in a channel or pattern.

 To the right of the title bar is a small box with the letter "S" or "A".

 S - Only the current sample will be transposed. 
 A - All the samples from $00-$1F will be transposed.

 To toggle between the two, click on the edit op. title bar.
 
 If the config entry "TransDel" is enabled, all the notes transposed out of
 range (C-1 to B-3) will be deleted. If not, they will not be transposed.



 Edit op. screen 2: (Record)

 ## Record ## 
 Patt - Record current pattern only. 
 Song - When recording, PT will move through the patterns in the
        song, just like normal play.

 ## Quantize ##
 Will move the notes you record to every n'th row. Entering 00 will 
 turn off the quantizing, and the notes you play will always be 
 inserted at the row you are at. Entering 01 will quantize
 the notes the the nearest row according to the speed. i.e. if you 
 play a note after the first half has been played, it will be quantized
 to the row below. Entering a value like 8 will quantize to every 8th
 row, and so on. Got that? 

 ## Metro (metronome) ##
 The first number is the speed of the metronome, and the second is the 
 channel to play it on. The sample used for metronomes is always sample
 31/$1F. Load your own favourite metronome sample.
 To turn off the metronome, just set the speed or channel to 00. 

 ## Multi ##
 When on, PT will jump to another channel after you play a note on the
 keyboard. This makes it possible to play two or more notes at the same
 time.



 Edit Op. screen 2: (samples)

 To the right of the title bar is a small box with the letter "T", "P"
 or "S".

 T - Copy & Exchange apply to current track (channel) only.
 P - Copy & Exchange will affect the the whole pattern.
 S - Copy & Exchange will apply to the real samples in memory.

 To toggle between the two, click on the edit op. title bar.

 ## Delete ##
 Will delete all notes with the current sample in current channel or whole
 pattern.

 ## Kill ##
 Will kill the current sample. That is, remove it from memory and reset
 all sample settings.

 ## EXCHGE (exchange) ##
 Will exchange the sample number shown in the "from" gadget with the sample
 number in the "to" gadget and vice versa. "T" or "P" selects track (channel) or
 pattern. "S" exchanges the samples.

 ## MOVE ##
 Will move the sample number shown in the "from" gadget to the sample
 number in the "to" gadget.



 Edit Op. screen 3: (Sample Editor)

 To the right of the title bar is a small box with the letter "H" or "C".

 H - Will halve the volume on many sample altering effects to avoid clipping.
 C - Will not halve the volume. The sample may be clipped.
 
 To toggle between the two, click on the edit op. title bar.

 ## Mix ## 
 Will mix one sample with another. PT asks you which two samples to be
 mixed, and where to put the result.

 Holding the right button and pressing mix will mix the current sample with
 itself. You can offset the sample by setting a position in the "pos" gadget.
 If you set "mod" to a non-zero value, the sample will also be modulated. 

 ## Echo ##
 Will create a echo effect on the current sample. Use "pos" to set the 
 delay time of the echo. If you want more room to echo in, just turn up
 the length of the sample.

 ## Boost (treble increase) ##
 Will turn up the treble of the sample. Use this on hi-hats and snares!

 ## Filter (treble decrease) ##
 Will Delta-filter the sample (treble decrease). Use this on noisy basses.

 ## X-Fade (crossfade) ##
 Will crossfade the sample (mix with itself, backwards). Handy for looping
 samples that are hard to loop.

 ## Backwd (backwards) ##
 Will turn the sample backwards.

 ## Upsamp (upsample) ##
 Will remove every second byte of the sample, halving the length and 
 shifting the pitch one octave up.

 ## Dnsamp (downsample) ##
 Will double every byte of the sample, doubling the length, and shifting
 the pitch one octave down. If you downsample samples longer than $7FFE, 
 you will lose the end of them. 

 ## POS ##
 This is just an offset in the sample, used for a lot of things.

 ## MOD (modulate) ##
 This is used for modulation. Press "MOD" to modulate the current sample.

 ## CB (Cut Beginning) ##
 Will chop the number of bytes set in the "pos" gadget off the beginning of
 the sample.

 ## Chord ##
 Will take you to the Sample Chord Editor screen.
 
 ## FU (Fade Up) ##
 Will fade the volume from 0 to 100%. Use "Pos" to select where in the
 sample to fade up to.

 ## FD (Fade Down) ##
 Will fade the volume from 100 to 0%. Use "Pos" to select where in the
 sample to fade down from.

 ## VOL ##
 With this you can change the "real" volume of the sample. Just set a
 percentage and press "VOL".

 Edit Op.3 is now intended to be used with the new sample editor. If a 
 range is marked, some of the functions apply to the range only. If there's
 no range marked, the functions will affect the whole sample. You may also
 set "POS" by clicking on the sample and setting the cursor line.



 Edit Op. screen 4: (Sample Chord Editor)
 
 ## Chord ##
 Will make the chord, using the current sample and the notes chosen, and
 the chord will be put in the current sample or a free sample slot, depending
 on your choice (see below).

 ## Reset ##
 Will reset the notes and the length.

 ## Undo ##
 Will undo the last change (apart from multiple arrow up/down).
 
 ## Length ##
 Will set the length to the maximum value, depending on the length of
 the original sample and the notes you chose. This will of course set
 the ':' after the 4 length digits (see below).
 Holding the right mouse button will set the length to the minimum depending
 on the notes chosen. '.' will be shown after the 4 digits. Mixing with the
 minimum length will make the sample as long as the shortest sample of the
 four resampled notes.
 Looped samples will always be 65534 in length so that it's easier for you
 to find good sample loop points.

 ## Major ##
 Will set a major chord, depending on the basenote.

 ## Minor ##
 Will set a minor chord, depending on the basenote.

 ## Sus-4 ##
 Will set a suspended fourth chord, depending on the basenote.

 ## Major7 ##
 Will set a major seventh chord, depending on the basenote.

 ## Minor7 ##
 Will set a minor seventh chord, depending on the basenote.

 ## Major6 ##
 Will set a major sixth chord, depending on the basenote.

 ## Minor6 ##
 Will set a minor sixth chord, depending on the basenote.

 ## 4 notegadgets ##
 The upper one is the basenote. If you press a gadget, PT will wait for you
 to press a note. Holding the right mouse button will reset the note.

 ## 4 Up/Down gadgets ##
 Will add/sub 1 halfnote from the current note. Holding right mouse button will
 add/sub 1 octave. You can reset the note by adding past B-3.

 ## The 4 rightmost gadgets ##
 Works just like the edit op gadgets.
 1,2,3 takes you to the corresponding edit screen, and E exits.

 ## The status line ##
 Pressing the upper line will toggle between New or Old sample: If N, then
 PT will search for a free sample to put the result in. If O, then PT will
 put the result in the current sample, overwriting it.

 Note #1
 -------
 PT puts a '!' last in the sample name to show you that this is a chord
 sample. The '!' is for you to see where the destination sample has gone,
 it has nothing to do with the program. You can take the '!' away and
 rename the sample to ...-major, ...-minor etc for instance.

 Note #2
 -------
 The chosen option on the status line in edit op. 3, H(alve) or C(lip)
 will NOT affect the chord mixing. The mixing is done in 16-bit, then
 normalized and quantized to 8-bit using rounding.
 


             EFFECT COMMANDS
             ---------------

 Effect commands on ProTracker should
 be compatible with all other trackers.

 0 - None/Arpeggio          8 - * NOT USED *
 1 - Pitch Slide Up         9 - Sample Offset
 2 - Pitch Slide Down       A - Volume Slide
 3 - Tone Portamento        B - Position Jump
 4 - Vibrato                C - Set Volume
 5 - Tone Porta + VolSlide  D - Pattern Break
 6 - Vibrato + VolSlide     E - Misc. Cmds

              E - COMMANDS
              ------------

 The E command has been altered to contain more commands than one.

 E0- LED Filter On/Off      E8- * NOT USED *
 E1- Fine Pitch Slide Up    E9- Note Retrig
 E2- Fine Pitch Slide Down  EA- Fine Volume Slide Up
 E3- Glissando Control      EB- Fine Volume Slide Down
 E4- Set Vibrato Waveform   EC- Note Cut
 E5- Set Finetune           ED- Note Delay
 E6- Pattern Loop           EE- Pattern Delay
 E7- Set Tremolo Waveform   EF- Invert Loop



 Cmd 0. Arpeggio [Range:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 -----------------------------------
 Usage: $0 + 1st halfnote add
           + 2nd halfnote add

 Arpeggio is used to simulate chords. This is done by rapidly changing the
 pitch between 3 (or 2) different notes. It sounds very noisy and grainy on
 most samples, but okay on monotone ones.

 Example: C-300047  C-major chord: (C+E+G  or C+4+7 halfnotes)
          C-300037  C-minor chord: (C+D#+G or C+3+7 halfnotes)



 Cmd 1. Pitch Slide Up [Speed:$00-$FF]
 -------------------------------------
 Usage: $1 + slide speed

 This will simply slide the sample pitch up. You can NOT slide
 higher than B-3! (Period 113)

 Example: C-300103  1 is the command, 3 is the slide speed.

 NOTE: The pitch slide will be called as many times as the speed of the song.
 This means that you'll sometimes have trouble sliding accurately. If you
 change the speed without changing the slide rates, it will sound bad...



 Cmd 2. Pitch Slide Down [Speed:$00-FF]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: $2 + slide speed

 Just like command 1, except that this one slides the pitch down instead.
 (adds to the period).

 You can NOT slide lower than C-1! (period 856)

 Example: C-300203  2 is the command, 3 is the slide speed.



 Cmd 3. Tone Portamento [Speed:$00-$FF]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: Dest-note + $3 + slidespeed

 This command will automatically slide from the old note to the new.
 You don't have to worry about which direction to slide, you need only set
 the slide speed. To keep on sliding, just select the command $3 + 00.

 Example: A-200000  First play a note.
          C-300305  C-3 is the note to slide to, 3 the command,
                    and 5 the speed.



 Cmd 4. Vibrato [Rate:$0-$F,Depth:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $4 + vibratorate + vibratodepth
 
 Vibrato will vibrate the sample pitch with a waveform (FM synthesis).

 Example: C-300481  4 is the command, 8 is the speed of the vibrato,
                    and 1 is the depth of the vibrato.

 To keep on vibrating, just select the command $4 + 00. To change the
 vibrato, you can alter the rate, depth or both. Use command E4- to
 change the vibrato waveform.



 Cmd 5. Tone Portamento + Volume Slide [Speed:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Usage: $5 + upspeed + downspeed
 
 This command will continue the current tone portamento and slide the volume
 at the same time. Compatible with Noisetracker 2.0.

 Example: C-300503  3 is the speed to turn the volume down.
          C-300540  4 is the speed to slide it up.



 Cmd 6. Vibrato + Volume Slide [Speed:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 -------------------------------------------------
 Usage: $6 + upspeed + downspeed

 This command will continue the current vibrato and slide the volume at the
 same time. Compatible with Noisetracker 2.0.

 Example: C-300605  5 is the speed to turn the volume down.
          C-300640  4 is the speed to slide it up.



 Cmd 7. Tremolo [Rate:$0-$F,Depth:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $7 + tremolorate + tremolodepth

 Tremolo will vibrate the volume with a waveform (AM synthesis).

 Example: C-300794  7 is the command, 9 is the speed of the tremolo,
                    and 4 is the depth of the tremolo.

 To keep on tremolo'ing, just select the command $7 + 00. To change the
 tremolo, you can alter the rate, depth or both. Use command E7- to
 change the tremolo waveform.



 Cmd 9. Set Sample Offset [Offs:$00-$FF]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $9 + sample offset

 This command will play from a chosen position in the sample, and not from
 the beginning. The two numbers equal the two first numbers in the length
 of the sample. Handy for speech samples.
 Due to a bug in the ProTracker replayer, attempting to use this command on
 samples longer than 65534/$FFFF will result in no sound.

 Example: C-300923  Play sample from offset $2300.



 Cmd A. Volume Slide [Speed:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $A + upspeed + downspeed

 Example: C-300A05  5 is the speed to turn the volume down.
          C-300A40  4 is the speed to slide it up.

 NOTE: The slide will be called as many times as the speed of the song.
 The slower the song, the more the volume will be changed on each note.



 Cmd B. Position Jump [Pos:$00-$7F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $B + position to continue at

 Example: C-300B01  B is the command, 1 is the position to
                    restart the song at.

 This command will also perform a pattern break (see 2 pages below).

 You can use this command instead of restart as on Noisetracker, but you 
 must enter the position in hex!



 Cmd C. Set Volume [Volume:$00-$40]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $C + new volume

 Well, this old familiar command will set the current volume to your own
 selected. The highest volume is $40. All volumes are represented in hex.
 (programmers do it in hex, you know!)

 Example: C-300C10  C is the command, 10 is the volume (16 decimal).



 Cmd D. Pattern Break [Row:00-63, decimal]
 -----------------------------------------
 Usage: $D + row

 This command just jumps to the next song position, and continues play
 from the row you specify.

 Example: C-300D00  Jump to the next song position and continue play
                    from row 00.
      Or: C-300D32  Jump to the next song position and continue play
                    from row 32 instead.



 Cmd E0. Set LED Filter [Range:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------------
 Usage: $E0 + value (0 = on, anything else = off)

 This command jerks around with the stupid LED filter.
 No one should ever use it.

 Example: C-300E01  turns LED filter off
          C-300E00  turns LED filter on



 Cmd E1. Fine Pitch Slide Up [Range:$0-$F]
 -----------------------------------------
 Usage: $E1 + value

 This command works just like the normal portamento up, except that
 it only slides up once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300E11  Slide up 1 at the beginning of the note.

 (great for creating chorus effects)



 Cmd E2. Fine Pitch Slide Down [Range:$0-$F]
 -------------------------------------------
 Usage: $E2 + value

 This command works just like the normal portamento down, except that
 it only slides down once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300E26  Slide up 6 at the beginning of the note.



 Cmd E3. Glissando Control [Range:$0-$1]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $E3 + glissando control

 Glissando must be used with the tone portamento command. When glissando is
 activated, tone portamento will slide a halfnote at a time, instead of a
 straight slide.

 Example: C-300E31  Turn Glissando on.
          C-300E30  Turn Glissando off.



 Cmd E4. Set Vibrato Waveform [Range:$0-$3]
 ------------------------------------------
 Usage: $E4 + vibrato waveform

               E44  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E41  Set Ramp Down
               E45  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E42  Set Squarewave
               E46  Don't retrig WF



 Cmd E5. Set Finetune [Range:$0-$F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $E5 + finetune value

 Example: C-300E51  Set finetune to 1.

 Use these tables to figure out the finetune value.

 Finetune: +7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +1  0
    Value:  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

 Finetune: -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8
    Value:  F  E  D  C  B  A  9  8



 Cmd E6. Pattern Loop [Loops:$0-$F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $E6 + number of loops

 This command will loop a part of a pattern.

 Example: C-300E60  Set loop start.
          C-300E63  Jump to loop 3 times before playing on.



 Cmd E7. Set Tremolo Waveform [Range:$0-$3]
 ------------------------------------------
 Usage: $E7 + tremolo waveform

 Example: C-300E70  Set sine (default)
               E74  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E71  Set Ramp Down
               E75  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E72  Set Squarewave
               E76  Don't retrig WF



 Cmd E9. Note Retrig [Value:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------
 Usage: $E9 + tick to retrig note at

 This command will retrig the same note before playing the next. Where to
 retrig depends on the speed of the song. If you retrig with 1 in speed 6
 that note will be trigged 6 times in one note slot. Retrig on hi-hats!

 Example: C-300F06  Set speed to 6.
          C-300E93  Retrig at tick 3 out of 6.



 Cmd EA. Fine Volume Slide Up [Range:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------------------
 Usage: $EA + value

 This command works just like the normal volume slide up, except that
 it only slides up once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300EA3  Slide volume up 1 at the beginning of the note.



 Cmd EB. Fine Volume Slide Down [Range:$0-$F]
 --------------------------------------------
 Usage: $EB + value

 This command works just like the normal volume slide down, except that
 it only slides down once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300EB6  Slide volume down 6 at the beginning of the note.



 Cmd EC. Note Cut [Value:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------
 Usage: $EC + tick to cut note at

 This command will cut the note at the selected tick, creating
 extremely short notes.

 Example: C-300F06  Set speed to 6.
          C-300EC3  Cut at tick 3 out of 6.

 Note that the note is not really cut, the volume is just turned down.



 Cmd ED. Note Delay [Value:$0-$F]
 --------------------------------
 Usage: $ED + ticks to delay note

 This command will delay the note to the selected tick.

 Example: C-300F06  Set speed to 6.
          C-300ED3  Play note at tick 3 out of 6.

 You can play the same note on two channels, delay one, and get a
 nice flanger effect.



 Cmd EE. Pattern Delay [Notes:$0-$F]
 -----------------------------------
 Usage: $EE + notes to delay pattern

 This command will delay the pattern the selected numbers of notes.

 Example: C-300EE8  Delay pattern 8 notes before playing on.

 All other effects are still active when the pattern is being delayed.



 Cmd EF. Invert Loop [Speed:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------
 Usage: $EF + Invertspeed

 This command will need a short loop ($10,20,40,80 etc. bytes) to work.
 It will invert the loop byte by byte.

 Example: C-300EF8 Set invspeed to 8.

 To turn off the inverting, set invspeed to 0, or press ctrl + Z.



 Cmd F. Set Speed [Speed:$00-$FF]
 --------------------------------
 Usage: $F + speed

 This command will set the speed of the song (ticks per row).

Vblank: Range 01-FF - Normal timing  

   CIA: Range 01-1F - Set vblank speeds with CIA timing.
   CIA: Range 20-FF - Set BPM speeds, range 32-255.
  Both: Range 00    - STOP song.

             GENERAL INFO.
             -------------
 Making Music
 ------------
 Any piece of music written with ProTracker is built up from patterns.
 Each pattern is built up from four channels, one for each of the Amiga's
 audio channels.

 A pattern is 64 lines long. The middle line is always the one you edit.
 If you need shorter patterns, use the pattern break (Dxx) effect command.

 A channel is built up like this:

     32  C-3 01 C20
     /   \_/ |/ \_/
    /    /   |    \
  Row Note Sample Effect/Command

 The C-3 is the note being played at row 32. 01 is the sample number,
 and the three last digits are the effect command, in this case, set
 volume to $20 (C-Command, 20-Value).

 ProTracker holds a table with info about the sequence in which the patterns
 will be played. With the "Pos" gadget you determine your position in the table.
 With "Pattern" you define what pattern to play at that position.
 "Length" defines the total size of the table. The full sequence of patterns
 is the song. A song is built up from up to 100 different patterns, each
 being played at up to 128 different positions.

 The small gadgets labeled "I" and "D" are Insert and Delete. With those you
 can insert or delete a position from your song. The length of your song
 will be adjusted automatically. Remember that the length of your song
 must always be one more than the last position, since the first position
 is 0.

 Holding down the right mouse button when pressing the Pos, Pattern and Length
 gadgets will speed them up a bit.


 Finetune
 --------
 This is a goodie. Tune your untuned samples to match the others.
 Holding right mouse button while clicking will set finetune to zero.

     0 436.4 hz    -1 432.1 hz
     1 439.0 hz    -2 429.6 hz
     2 441.6 hz    -3 426.3 hz
     3 445.1 hz    -4 423.1 hz
     4 447.8 hz    -5 419.9 hz
     5 451.5 hz    -6 416.7 hz
     6 455.2 hz    -7 414.4 hz
     7 457.0 hz    -8 412.0 hz


 Sample 
 ------
 Clicking on the sample up/down gadgets will flicker through the
 samples. You can use up to 31 (hex $1F) samples in a song.

 Sample zero function
 --------------------
 Pressing both mouse buttons at the same time will set the sample number
 to 'zero'. You can then record/edit the pattern with sample 0 to prevent
 ProTracker from setting the volume each time you play a new note.

 Length
 ------
 The Length gadgets are simply used for setting the length of the sample.
 A sample can be up to 128k, 131070/$1fffe long. Do note that any lengths
 above 64k/65534/$fffe will make the real Amiga ProTracker act strange in the
 GUI. It will play the song fine, except that 9xx (sample offset) forces the
 sample to not play if >64k. This happens in this ProTracker clone too.

 Volume
 ------
 Use this to set the volume the current sample will be played at.

 Repeat (loop start)
 ------
 Here you set the start of the sample loop.

 Replen (loop length)
 ------
 Here you set the length of the sample loop.

 Pressing both the left and right button on the sample gadgets will
 speed them up a bit.

 The Pattern Number Gadget
 -------------------------
 To the middle left of the screen is a box with a number in it. The number
 is the current pattern number.

 The "Are you sure?" dialog
 --------------------------
 In addition to the gadgets, you can use "Y" or Return for Yes,
 and "N" or ESC for No. Clicking the right mouse button also acts as No.

 The Clear dialog
 ----------------
 In addition to the gadgets you can use "A" for All, "O" for Song, "S" for
 samples and "C" or ESC for Cancel. Clicking the right mouse button acts
 as Cancel.

 The Load (sample) gadget
 ------------------------
 This gadget will set DISK OP. "load sample" mode and enter the DISK OP.

 The text input routine
 ----------------------
 Now this is really simple. Clicking on a text line will enable you to edit
 it. Some text lines are longer than they seem, so use the arrow keys to
 scroll back and forth in the text. You can also use HOME/END on your keyb.
 The text input mode is just like an ordinary text editor. You can use
 backspace, delete, space, numeric pad keys and such.
 Pressing Return will exit text edit mode and save the changes.
 Pressing the right mouse button will clear the text line and exit the editing.
 Use ESC to just exit.


 Tips 'n tricks
 --------------
 When inserting, pasting or join-pasting, hold down shift to keep the
 cursor from jumping to the end of the block. e.g. shift+ctrl+p

 Holding shift while pressing ctrl+k (kill to end of channel) will kill to
 start of channel instead.

 Use ESC or right mouse button to exit from a lot of things.


 Effect tips
 -----------
 You can set the volume without playing a note. e.g. ---01000
 This will set the volume for sample 1 without trigging the note.

 Or try trigging the sample and sliding
 the volume down. e.g. C-301A08
                       ---01A08
                       ---01A08
 This will create a strange arpeggiato effect, like on "Cream of the earth"
 by Romeo Knight / RSI.
 
 Entering a new sample number without a note will swap to the new sample
 after the previous one was done playing. This is useful for creating
 a sweeping effect on chiptune styled songs, and so on.


 Mouse Pointer Colors
 --------------------

 Gray      - Nothing is happening.

 Drumpad
 -------
 ProTracker features a drumpad as in Noisetracker 2.0 and 2.1.
 Use '\' instead of period '.' to toggle modes. One or
 more dots will appear to the right of the TUNE/TIMING display.

 No dots: Normal keypad.
   1 dot: Drumpad.
  2 dots: Drumpad - Edit/Rec possible.

 Use alt+keypadkey to set note.


 That's all for now, I hope you enjoy my ProTracker v2.3D clone as much
 as I did making it.
